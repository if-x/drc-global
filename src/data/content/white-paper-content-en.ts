      "COVID-19 pandemic has caused a substantial disruption of the global economy. To preserve its stability, central banks across the globe have significantly eased monetary policy by cutting policy rates and provided enormous liquidity to the market. However, fiscal and monetary policies implemented because of the economic crisis have exposed serious vulnerabilities in the current financial system. Historically, the increase in the money supply causes inflation and reduces purchasing power. During the economic recession, people tend to lose their trust in a centralized financial system and hedge inflation risks by investing in “store of value” assets that are expected to retain or increase their value over time.",

      "Current financial system with a central authority has an inherent problem: the goals of the authority can diverge from the goals of the users of the system. With the introduction of Bitcoin, it became clear that the governance system can function in a decentralized manner. Bitcoin introduced an innovative approach to processing payments without a trusted third party. The functions of a bank have been replaced by an open-source software where network participants vote with their computing power to determine whether a financial transaction is valid.",
      "Ethereum, the second largest blockchain, allows its users to build decentralized financial applications. Whereas traditional financial system is based on centralized infrastructure that is managed by authorities, institutions, and intermediaries, decentralized finance is powered by a public code. By deploying smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain, it became possible to launch innovative financial products that are available to almost anyone. The sector is growing exponentially, and we may witness a global adoption of decentralized finance in the foreseeable future.",

    heading: "III. GROWING DEMAND FOR A DIGITAL STORE OF VALUE",
    contents: [
      "We expect the demand for decentralized “store of value” assets to rise considerably as the risk of currency debasement increases. Institutional and individual investors become more aware of the serious flaws in the current financial system. This awareness will drive demand for non-correlated alternative asset classes and “store of value” assets, especially in the blockchain space. Our conviction is that the monetary value and the security of a store of value need not relate to any centralized power and blockchain technology elegantly solves this problem.",
      "Currently, gold and bitcoin are considered the most efficient “store of value” assets. Both of them not much correlated with traditional asset classes and retain their market value despite global economic downturns. However, bitcoin has significant advantage over gold because of its digital form, decentralized nature, and portability. At the same time, despite the fact that Bitcoin has an algorithmically predetermined limited supply, it has a disinflationary economic model and its production will continue until ~2140.",

    heading: "IV. DRC ECONOMIC MODEL AND DISTRIBUTION",
    contents: [
      "Digital Reserve Currency (DRC) was designed to become a decentralized digital store of value with a limited supply and a zero inflation rate. DRC was created during the COVID-19 pandemic with the purpose of finding out how the global economic recession and the increasing demand for decentralized financial instruments may affect its adoption and usage.",
      "The total supply of DRC is fixed at 1,000,000,000 indivisible tokens. 100% of the total DRC token supply has been issued to the Uniswap market with intentionally low initial market cap to allow early adopters to establish inexpensive exposure to DRC if they believe it will have a larger market in the future.",
      "No DRC tokens have ever been premined or retained by the project developers. DRC has a predetermined finite supply and no more additional DRC tokens will ever be minted. The scarcity of DRC was embedded into the code and nothing can change it once DRC contract was deployed into Ethereum network. The token supply will not be artificially reduced by either buybacks or token burning.",
      "Despite the intentionally small initial market capitalization, we cannot predict whether DRC token will retain its monetary value in the future. DRC token may lose its value if it does not receive adoption as a digital store of value. At the same time, DRC token value may arise because of the network effect, as more people believe in its intrinsic value and utility.",

      "DRC token has the unique utility of providing DRC holders with the exclusive access to the Digital Reserve, an essential part of the DRC ecosystem. Digital Reserve is an online platform where DRC holders can get instant exposure to the baskets of the most efficient store of value assets, with the purpose of capital preservation and hedging inflation risks. DRC holders will also have access to alternative vaults, designed for users with higher risk tolerance.",
      "The composition and asset allocation of Digital Reserve vaults are decided by the DRC community. There is no single entity or person that manage Digital Reserve, as users interact directly with the Digital Reserve smart contract. The smart contract has been created by the DRC community and audited by the Dedaub blockchain security firm. Digital Reserve assets are held in the secure multisig wallet managed by the DRC community.",

    heading: "VI. CONCLUSION",
    contents: [
      "A new asset that has a limited supply and is extremely secure has true value. The fact that it is censorship-resistant and portable makes it more advanced than gold or fiat money. Because of the flaws in the current financial system, with its overvalued assets, leveraged products, and centralized manipulation, the demand for decentralized and censorship-resistant “store of value” assets would increase significantly over time.",
      "DRC token has the potential to become a decentralized digital store of value with a zero inflation rate. The token is fully developed and operational and its holders are immediately able to use it for its intended functionality on the Ethereum network. The DRC token structure and limited supply are embedded into the code that cannot be changed even by its creator.",
      "The DRC ecosystem is community-driven. No one has managerial control over DRC nor provides essential managerial efforts that affect its success as the DRC ecosystem has fully decentralized structure.",
